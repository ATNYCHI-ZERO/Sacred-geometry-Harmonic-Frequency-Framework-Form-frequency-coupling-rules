Formal Definitions

Arctan Fold Spiral Law: Define the standardized variable 
𝑧
=
(
𝑥
−
𝜇
)
/
𝜎
z=(x−μ)/σ for any real data 
𝑥
x (with mean 
𝜇
μ and scale 
𝜎
σ). Then map 
𝑦
=
ln
⁡
𝑧
y=lnz and 
𝜃
=
arctan
⁡
(
𝑦
)
θ=arctan(y). Equivalently,

𝜃
(
𝑥
)
=
arctan
⁡

(
ln
⁡
𝑥

𝜇
𝜎
)
 
.
θ(x)=arctan(ln
σ
x−μ
	​

).

This produces a bounded logarithmic spiral in polar coordinates (with radius 
𝑟
=
𝑥
r=x)

. (The “fold spiral” law generates self-similar spiral patterns; for example, plotting primes via 
𝜃

=arctan(lnp) yields the Ulam prime spiral

HRC Axiom I (0.5-shift): Including 0 as an anchor point shifts any numeric range’s midpoint by +0.5. Formally, for a contiguous range 
{
0
,
…
,
𝑁
}
{0,…,N}, the “fold axis” becomes 
0
+
𝑁
2
2
0+N
	​

 instead of 
𝑁
2
2
N
	​

. For example, the range 0–15 has a center (fold-point) at 7.5

. (This axiom implies the golden ratio 
𝜙
ϕ emerges as a fixed point when requiring self-consistency under a 0.5 shift
academia.edu
.)

HRC Axiom II (Fold-average): Division is treated as a binary fold. In particular, 
2
÷
2
2÷2 is viewed as the “fold” of the unordered pair 
(
1
,
0
)
(1,0). Taking the average 
(
1
+
0
)
/
2
=
0.5
(1+0)/2=0.5 yields the fold-axis for that division operation
academia.edu
. (Together, Axiom I and II guarantee that the constants 
{
1
,
0
,
𝑖
,
𝜙
}
{1,0,i,ϕ} emerge as invariant fold-values

Mathematical Proofs

The Recursive Harmonic Codex (Bolt & Jackson, 2025) claims extensive proofs of the framework’s consequences. For example, the paper shows mathematically that the Arctan spiral mapping is invariant under shifts of the observer’s reference, and it proves mirror-symmetry of primes about the 7.5 fold‐axis

academia.edu
. The authors state that they “derive mathematical results linking number theory (Riemann ζ, Euler products) and wave mechanics” to consciousness, and illustrate this with “extensive proofs and visualizations” of spiral and prime-harmonic patterns
academia.edu
academia.edu
. (These proofs are outlined in the codex manuscript; full derivations reportedly appear in appendices.) In short, the available abstract and excerpts emphasize rigorous demonstration of the coupling rules, even if the detailed proofs are not publicly excerpted here

Code and Implementations

No code was directly found in the (unavailable) paper. However, related work is implemented in open projects. In particular, the NEXAH-CODEX GitHub repository (by Scarabaeus1033, Thomas Hofmann et al.) contains code, visualizations and documentation of resonance geometry concepts aligned with harmonic-frequency frameworks. That repo (titled “NEXAH-CODEX: Universal resonance structures”) hosts algorithms and graphics for cosmic grids, prime harmonics, etc. (none of which were directly excerpted from the paper in question). The repository itself is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
github.com
, meaning all code/text there is open but non-commercial. (The “NEXAH-CODEX” content serves as an implementation example of sacred-harmonic geometry ideas, but no code specifically labeled as “Harmonic Frequency Framework” was identified.)

Licensing Information

The related research publications are openly licensed. For example, Bolt & Jackson explicitly note that their Harmonic Recursive Codex work is released under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license

. By contrast, the NEXAH-CODEX GitHub materials are under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (non-commercial share-alike)
github.com
. No other licensing information (e.g. for proprietary code) was found, since the original paper’s content is not public.
